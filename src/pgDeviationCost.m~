function price = pgDeviationCost(originalPg,originalOnoff,y,gencost)

%notice that totcost returns (positive even if zeros?)
% y are epigraph values, so this line doesn't really work.
% price=sum(abs((originalOnoff).*totcost(gencost,originalPg)-y));
%this is because y is chosen to be higher and equal to the totcost and we
%get a difference of 0, which is not correct.
price=sum(abs((originalOnoff).*totcost(gencost,originalPg)-y));
